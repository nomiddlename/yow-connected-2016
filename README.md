# Progressive Web Apps: What has the Web ever done for us?

[View the slides](https://nomiddlename.github.io/yow-connected-2016/). The presentation uses the excellent [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) - most of the files in this repo belong to that package.

Below is the original proposal I submitted to [YOW! Connected](http://connected.yowconference.com.au).

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) bring us a step closer to not needing to develop native mobile apps. They bring with them some benefits and some drawbacks. This talk will give developers (whether they are web or native, mobile or desktop) an insight into the problems that PWAs can solve, how you go about building them, and some ways to decide if they are right for your project.

I'll begin with an overview of some of the problems that app developers (and product owners) face today:

* Increasing app discovery - the app stores are full of other apps, how will they find yours?
* SEO
* Sharing
* Reducing barriers to getting your app installed
* Reducing time to first interaction

Then we'll discuss what PWAs are and see how they can help solve these problems. Specifically, weâ€™ll look at:

* What is a PWA?
* How do they help app discovery?
* How do they help get an app installed?
* How do you build a PWA?
* Service workers
* Reducing time to first interaction with caching and app skeletons
* Push notifications
* App updates
* Installation
* Platforms and compatibility

Along the way, I'll demonstrate a working app - providing a view of those features in action or, in the event of a demo failure, proof of Murphy's Law in action.

Finally, I'll then provide some ideas of suitable application types for PWAs - clearly, this isn't a technology that's necessarily useful for all apps.

Developers should leave the session knowing more about this technology, and how it could help them in their next project.
