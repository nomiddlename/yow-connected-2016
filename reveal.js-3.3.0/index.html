					What has the web ever done for us?
					<section>Nothing
						<aside class="notes">
							As a mobile developer these days we tend to think of native apps as the gold standard,
							with a mobile web app as a fallback - responsive design if you're lucky, or just dump
							them onto the desktop site if not. You've just got to have a native app if you want to
							give the user the best experience.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>Well, there's links
						<aside class="notes">
							Links are the web's superpower, they're what made it great. They are still how a large
							percentage of traffic makes it to most sites - people sharing links, not through facebook
							or other trackable means, but by emails to friends or instant messages. It's been called
							"Dark Social".
							http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/dark-social-we-have-the-whole-history-of-the-web-wrong/263523/

							Clicking on links on a mobile device is a delightful journey into install-the-native-app
							popup begging. Remember the good old days when clicking on a link took you to the content
							you wanted?
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>...and searching
						<aside class="notes">
							Being able to find your app in the store relies on the user typing in pretty much your app's
							exact name. So they already have to know about you and that your app exists. Unless you can get
							on the front page of the app store, or into the top 10 list for a category.

							On the web, they're used to just typing in vaguely what they want and having Google's mind-reading
							satellites pick out what they really wanted. And apps don't turn up much in the results - unless you
							pay for those ads.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>...and freedom from walled gardens
						<aside class="notes">
							It's up to Apple/Google/Amazon if your app makes it into the store, and it's up to them when that happens as well.

							The web has no such restrictions, it's totally open. Anyone can put a site up, and link to whatever
							they want. They can be indexed by search engines in a day or two, and suddenly www.goatprices.com is
							making money.

					Native apps
					<section>...are totally sweet.
						<aside class="notes">
							Originally, the move to native over web was for performance.
							Your UI was slicker, you bundled up a lot of the furniture so that
							the user didn't have to download background images, etc. It was all
							about reducing the time to first interaction.

						Every step between your users and installing your app loses you 20% of them.
						<aside class="notes">
							Every barrier you put between the user and their goal will lose you about 20% of your audience.
							That sounds like I just made that statistic up, but I didn't. Someone else did.
							This is because your customer's goal (finding out about goat prices) is different to yours
							(getting them to install your app).

							Two-thirds of smartphone users install zero apps per month. They've got a handful of apps
							that they use for most purposes. In fact, 42% of app time happens in just one app.

						<aside class="notes">
							Progressive web apps are made up of a few reasonably simple technologies that can be used to
							enhance the mobile experience for users with browsers that support those technologies. The
							progressive part of the name comes from progressive enhancement, with the idea that these
							functions are extra bits. Your web app will still work without them.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>Time to first interaction
						<aside class="notes">
							Service workers allow you to cache an app skeleton, so that your mobile app is
							ready to go much sooner than a normal web app. Your service worker acts as a
							proxy allowing you to intercept http requests made by your page, and decide to
							serve them from a cache or not.

						<aside class="notes">
							If you've done the work to get a service worker and manifest on your site, then you're just a short
							step away from getting push notifications for your site as well.
