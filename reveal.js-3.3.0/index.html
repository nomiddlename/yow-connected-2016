					What has the web ever done for us?
					<section>Nothing
						<aside class="notes">
							As a mobile developer these days we tend to think of native apps as the gold standard,
							with a mobile web app as a fallback - responsive design if you're lucky, or just dump
							them onto the desktop site if not. You've just got to have a native app if you want to
							give the user the best experience.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>Well, there's links
						<aside class="notes">
							Links are the web's superpower, they're what made it great. They are still how a large
							percentage of traffic makes it to most sites - people sharing links, not through facebook
							or other trackable means, but by emails to friends or instant messages. It's been called
							"Dark Social".
							http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/10/dark-social-we-have-the-whole-history-of-the-web-wrong/263523/

							Clicking on links on a mobile device is a delightful journey into install-the-native-app
							popup begging. Remember the good old days when clicking on a link took you to the content
							you wanted?
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>...and searching
						<aside class="notes">
							Being able to find your app in the store relies on the user typing in pretty much your app's
							exact name. So they already have to know about you and that your app exists. Unless you can get
							on the front page of the app store, or into the top 10 list for a category.

							On the web, they're used to just typing in vaguely what they want and having Google's mind-reading
							satellites pick out what they really wanted. And apps don't turn up much in the results - unless you
							pay for those ads.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>...and freedom from walled gardens
						<aside class="notes">
							It's up to Apple/Google/Amazon if your app makes it into the store, and it's up to them when that happens as well.

							The web has no such restrictions, it's totally open. Anyone can put a site up, and link to whatever
							they want. They can be indexed by search engines in a day or two, and suddenly www.goatprices.com is
							making money.

						<aside class="notes">
							Originally, the move to native over web was for performance.

						Every step between your users and installing your app loses you 20% of them.
						<aside class="notes">
							Every barrier you put between the user and their goal will lose you about 20% of your audience.
							That sounds like I just made that statistic up, but I didn't. Someone else did.
							This is because your customer's goal (finding out about goat prices) is different to yours
							(getting them to install your app).

						<aside class="notes">
							Progressive web apps are made up of a few reasonably simple technologies that can be used to
							enhance the mobile experience for users with browsers that support those technologies. The
							progressive part of the name comes from progressive enhancement, with the idea that these

					<section>Time to first interaction
						<aside class="notes">
							Service workers allow you to cache an app skeleton, so that your mobile app is
							ready to go much sooner than a normal web app. Your service worker acts as a

							serve them from a cache or not.

						1. HTTPS only (localhost counts as secure)
						<aside class="notes">
							This is part of Google's move to prefer secure origins for new features. And service workers allow
							you to intercept any http request made on the page, so that's pretty powerful.

						<aside class="notes">
							Note that sw.js is in the root of the site - you can't ask for a higher
							level of scope, but you can ask for less. The API also uses promises.

							That call to "register" loads the service worker, and triggers an "install" event.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/sw-3.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Here you can see I'm setting up a cache, and adding some files to it for later on.
							At this point the sw is not running, that doesn't happen until you get the "activate" event.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/sw-4.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							Here we're clearing out old caches that we don't need any more.

							For here on, our service worker is running in the background. Not doing anything, but it's there.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/sw-5.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							To intercept requests, and behave like a proxy, we have to listen for the "fetch" event.

							event 'e' has a property 'request' which the Cache API can use a key for storing responses.

						<aside class="notes">
							Now, when we click onto another page, we get this.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<img src="images/sw-7.png"/>
						<aside class="notes">
							That's because we had this list of files in that "install" event at the start.

							You’ll have noticed code in the “activate” event handler that deletes old caches.
							When we want to update our components, we bump the cache version number, reload the
							page - the new service worker will become active and the old one deleted, and our
							cache replaced with a new one. Caveat: filling the service worker cache will make
							use of the browser cache, so if it doesn’t look like your pages are updating, then
							check that as well - it fooled me for a while, I was convinced my service worker was
							broken. I also thought this would be a great replacement for all those little
							cache-busting tricks we do. You could use this as a central place to manage script
							updates - but this fallback to the browser cache means you’d still need to include the
							cache-busting. But at least you’d have one place to do all your cache-busting.

							Memory limits - I couldn’t find anything which states exactly what the limits are.
							They’re browser-specific, and the spec states that the whole cache will be deleted
							if limits are reached, rather than piecemeal. Some suggest the limit is 5MB, shared
							amongst local storage, indexed db, cache.
